# 🏠 Zillow House Value Predictions Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This repository implements a machine learning workflow to predict house values based on historical Zillow housing data. The project includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It leverages robust algorithms and visualization tools to generate meaningful insights and accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection.
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of key trends and distributions.
- 🤖 **Regression Models**: Implements multiple models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score for assessment.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes historical housing data with features such as:
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage
- Location features
- Tax information
- Home value (`target`)

> **Source**: Zillow (replace with specific URL or dataset link if applicable)

## 🧠 Models

### 🔹 Linear Regression
- **Purpose**: Baseline model for price prediction.
- **Performance**: Interpretable but limited with nonlinear data.

### 🔹 Random Forest Regressor
- **Architecture**: Ensemble learning method using decision trees.
- **Advantage**: Handles nonlinearity and feature interactions well.

### 🔹 XGBoost Regressor
- **Architecture**: Gradient boosting framework optimized for performance.
- **Benefit**: Highly accurate, works well with tabular datasets.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**  
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**  

These metrics help compare model performance and select the best predictor for housing values.
